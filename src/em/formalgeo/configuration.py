                3.dependent_entities (dict): Tuple of symbols related to the dependency entities of the current entity,
                which are replaced with values before solving.
                4.solved_values (list): List of solved values, which stores multiple values obtained from solving, where
                the values correspond one-to-one with target_syms.
            examples: [([{'eq': [A.y-l.k*A.x-l.b], 'l': [], 'leq': [], 'g': [], 'geq': [], 'ueq': []}],
                       (l.k, l.b), (A.x, A.y), [(0, 0), (1, 1), ..., (999, 999)]),  # infinite solutions
                       ([{'eq': [A.y-l.k*A.x-l.b, B.y-l.k*B.x-l.b], 'l': [], 'leq': [], 'g': [], 'geq': [], 'ueq': []}],
                       (A.x, A.y, B.x, B.y), (l.k, l.b), [(1, 0)])]  # finite solutions

            self.attr_of_sym (dict): sym -> [attr]. The mapping from attribute symbols to attribute names. An attribute
            symbol may have multiple attribute names.
            examples: {A.x: ['A.x'], l.k: ['l.k'],  # parameter of entity
                       LengthOfSegment(AB): ['LengthOfSegment(AB)', 'LengthOfSegment(BA)']}  # attribution of entity

            self.value_of_sym (dict): sym -> value. The value of a symbol.

            the simplified equation, along with the fact_id of its original equation and the dependent equations used
            in the simplification process. Taking the equation a + b - c = 0 as an example, if the fact_id of a + b - c = 0
            and c - 2 = 0 are 1 and 2, respectively, then the element (a + b - 2, 1, [2]) would be added to self.equations.
            specifically:
                1.simplified_equation (equation): The simplified equation.
                2.original_equation_fact_id (int): The fact_id of its original equation.
                3.dependent_equation_fact_id (list): The dependent equations used in the simplification process. Note that
                all dependent equations are solved values. Whenever a symbol sym is successfully solved to obtain a value,
                an algebraic relation sym - value = 0 is constructed and added to the self.facts. Simultaneously, For each
                element in self.equations, all sym in the  simplified_equation are replaced with its value, and the fact_id
                of the algebraic relation sym - value = 0 is added to dependent_equation_fact_id. If the simplified_equation
                contains no unsolved symbols, remove current element from self.equations.
            example: [[a + b - 2, 1, [2]], [d + e, 2, []]]

        Methods:
            self.construct(entity): Construct a geometric entity (point, line, circle). If successfully construct the
            entity, return True; otherwise, return False.

            self.apply(theorem): Apply a theorem. If applying the theorem adds new conditions, return True; otherwise,
            return False.

        1.Parse the geometric construction statement, extract the target entity, implicit entities, and dependent
        entities, perform entity existence checks, format validity checks, and linear construction checks, and add the
        relations that do not contain implicit entities to the added_facts.

        2.Combine all constraints together, and update the implicit entities during the merging process.

        3.Solve the constraints to obtain the values of all unknown variables. For results involving random variables,
        generate random sampled values. Variables related to implicit entities, although solved for, will be ignored.
        Only the values of the variables related to the target entities are ultimately returned. This aligns with the
        first step of discarding relations that contain implicit entities. If an entity is implicit, we are not
        concerned with the implicit entity itself or its associated relations. The purpose of implicit entities is
        solely to transmit constraint relationships between the target entities and the dependent entities.

        4.Add all content generated by the current geometric construction statement to the database. This includes the
        current action, newly generated entities and their parameter values, and the generated relations, etc. Note that
        we also record the current constraints and their other solved values. This is primarily to serve the rollback
        functionality in future versions and is not used in the current version.

                include the entity currently being constructed, and the remaining entities must all be known entities.
